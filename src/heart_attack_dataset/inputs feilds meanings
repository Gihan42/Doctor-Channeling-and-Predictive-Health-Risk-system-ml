Medical Term Explanations:
cp (Chest Pain Type):

0: Asymptomatic (no pain)

1: Typical angina (chest pain related to reduced heart blood flow)

2: Atypical angina (non-heart-related chest pain)

3: Non-anginal pain (other types of chest pain)

trtbps (Resting Blood Pressure in mmHg):

Your value: 12 (This seems extremely low - normal is 90-120 mmHg)

Measures blood pressure at rest

chol (Serum Cholesterol in mg/dl):

Your value: 0 (Impossible biologically - normal is 125-200 mg/dl)

Measures cholesterol levels in blood

fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl):

0: False (â‰¤ 120 mg/dl)

1: True (> 120 mg/dl)

Your value suggests normal blood sugar

restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic Results):

0: Normal

1: ST-T wave abnormality

2: Left ventricular hypertrophy

Your value suggests an ECG abnormality

thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved):

Your value: 17 (Extremely low - normal is 60-200 bpm)

Measures peak heart rate during exercise

exang (Exercise Induced Angina):

0: No

1: Yes

Your value suggests no exercise-induced chest pain

oldpeak (ST Depression Induced by Exercise):

Your value: 1.4 (Mild abnormality)

Measures ECG changes during exercise

slope (Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment):

0: Downsloping

1: Flat

2: Upsloping (normal)

Your value shows normal response

ca (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy):

0-3: Number of visible vessels

Your value: 0 (No blockages visible)

thal (Thalassemia Stress Test Result):

1: Normal

2: Fixed defect

3: Reversible defect

Your value shows normal blood flow
